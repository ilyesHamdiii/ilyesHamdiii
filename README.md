# 👋 Hey, I'm ilyes hamdi

## 🚀 About Me
I started coding as a student out of curiosity — small scripts at first, then projects that made my day-to-day life a little easier. At some point, I realized I wasn’t just messing around anymore, I genuinely enjoyed solving problems with code.  

I’ve been growing with **Python** for most of my journey, and recently I’ve been exploring **Java**. Each language has its own way of thinking, and learning both has taught me to approach problems from different angles.  

For me, programming is less about chasing technologies and more about building things that work, learning step by step, and enjoying the process along the way.

## 🌱 A Few Things That Define Me

- I learn best by building small things and then slowly making them bigger.
